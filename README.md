# Simple Bank Project
This is a simple bank software developed in Java that runs in CLI. The user can create accounts (all only existent during runtime) and can use those to withdraw, deposit and transfer money. In order to create an account, the user has to inform some data, like:
 - their name;
 - a numerical 6 digit password;
 - their CPF (Brazilian SSN);
 - their adress.
After the accounts creation, all the operations can be done within the accounts.
